# ADPCM
C# program for converting a specific type of ADPCM file to WAV.

It's designed to convert ADPCM files from the Sega Dreamcast game Skies of Arcadia (with file extension P04) to WAV files.

It's a derivative work based on some code written by "BERO", and as that was covered by the GPL, so is this.
